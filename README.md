# Player Score Calculator (Python)
## Project Description
The **Player Score Calculator** is a simple Python program designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as **user input handling**, **data type conversion**, **arithmetic operations**, and **formatted output**.
The program calculates the **average score per game** based on user-provided inputs.
##  Objectives
This program demonstrates:
* Reading user input
* Converting input to appropriate data types
* Performing arithmetic calculations
* Displaying formatted output
## Task Requirements
The script performs the following steps:
1. Prompts the user to enter the **player’s name**
2. Accepts the **number of games played** (integer)
3. Accepts the **total score achieved** (integer)
4. Calculates the **average score per game**
5. Displays the output in a structured format
##  File Details
* **Filename:** `game_score.py`
* **Language:** Python 3
##  How to Run the Program
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Save the file as:
   game_score.py
3. Open a terminal or command prompt
4. Run the script using:
   python game_score.py
##  Sample Input
Enter player name: Alex
Enter number of games played: 5
Enter total score: 250
##  Sample Output
Player: Alex

Games Played: 5

Total Score: 250

Average Score: 50.0
## Concepts Used
* `input()` function
* Type conversion using `int()`
* Arithmetic operations
* String formatting
* Basic Python syntax
